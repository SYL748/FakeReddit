/* server/init.JSON
** You must write a script that will create documents in your database according
** to the datamodel you have defined for the application.  Remember that you 
** must at least initialize an admin user account whose credentials are derived
** from command-line arguments passed to this script. But, you should also add
** some communities, posts, comments, and link-flairs to fill your application
** some initial content.  You can use the initializeDB.js script as inspiration, 
** but you cannot just copy and paste it--you script has to do more to handle
** users.

/*
From Docs
Include a script called server/init.js in your repository that will be run to create initial data in
your schema. This script will be run using Node before starting the server. The initial data must
contain the user profile for admin. The email address, display name, and password for an admin
user must be provided as the command-line arguments to server/init.js. You must use these
credentials to create a user profile for admin in the database.
